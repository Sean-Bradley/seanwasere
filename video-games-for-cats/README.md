# Video Games for Cats

I made some video games for humans, but they are not very popular. 

My cat music is quite popular, so then I came up with the idea of making games for cats. 

I made 4 of them. 

My cat loves them and every night he sits next to my monitor waiting for me to start one of them up again.

## Butterfly Bash

Pretty butterflies fluttering randomly around the screen and hiding between the flowers.

## Cheeky Spider

Another cat game where a spider runs randomly around the screen. This is based on the spidermmo game I wrote for humans, but cats like my version for cats better.

## Tadpole Tease

This is a tadpole animation I created which your cat will love. It’s a bit like a string, but it’s alive.
